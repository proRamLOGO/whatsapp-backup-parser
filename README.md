# Whatsapp Backup Parser

This react project is a solution to one of the problems people face with Whatsapp. If you have an exported Whatsapp Chat as a text file, you had to view it in the text format only which could be really exasparating especially when their are tons of messages and have to be accesed frequently. 
The solution is to take such a text file and present it in an interface similar to that of the Whatsapp. So if you have any Whatsapp Exported Chat as a txt file then you could now conviniently access it as if you were looking at it in Whatsapp itself.
